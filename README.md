CSE005 Research Project 2 

edit the html file that is your section of the project :)
style.css has all the stylings that were on the top of evelyns initial code, any changes made in this file will change every pages style so they all look the same
we need to fix the proportion too cause full screen looks stratched out, but half a screen the website looks good lol but we can solve that later
