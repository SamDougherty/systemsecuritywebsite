<h1>Passwords</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Passwords are commonly used by individuals to protect their information from landing into the wrong hands. They are a crucial part of your security system because it keeps unauthorized users from being able to easily access your information. Passwords are the first line of defense for computer systems, so a strong password should always be used.</p>
<h2>Why are passwords important? </h2>
<p> A password is important because it helps you protect your computers from hackers or malicious software. It is like a personal key to a computer system that helps only authorized users to access these systems.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of a Strong Password:</h2>
</u1>
	<li>has not been used more than once</li>
	<li> has at least 11 characters</li>
	<li> long and unique</li>
	<li>contains special characters such as commas, periods, quotations, and exclamation marks</li>
	
</u1>
<h2>How to maintain your password</h2>
<p>A password should continuously be maintained. You should never share your password with anyone or write it down anywhere to prevent it from getting to the wrong hands. It should also be different across all of your accounts, so that if one account gets hacked, the rest are still not easily accessed.
</p>


<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>It may seem easier to create a password that is easy to remember, such as containing personal information or a simple easy word and number, but you should not. If a password is easy, then it will be easy for a hacker to guess it. A password should be strong, long, and unique to have a strong security system. The first line of defense can be crucial to protecting your information, therefore it should always be maintained and taken care of.</p>
