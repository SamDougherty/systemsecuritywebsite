   <h2 style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">What is a firewall?</h2>
   
  <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Firewalls are always mentioned in movies, especially when the movie is about hacking a system, but what even is a firewall? <br>How does a firewall work and should I even have one?</p>

  <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> Firewalls are a type of system security for technology to protect the individual from cyber attacks and breaches. This simple cyber defense mechanism is more important than many think. </p>

   <div class="card">
   <h2 style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;" > Firewall Basics</h2>
   
   <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">A systemâ€™s security has many ways to protect itself from the various types of threats and a firewall is one of them. A firewall is a <b>barrier </b>that keeps track of all incoming and outgoing network traffic and blocks any potential harmful external sources.</p>

     <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Firewalls have individual ports, where it acts as your systems bouncer. There are many different types of firewalls, and each will fall into one of two categories:<b> software and hardware</b>.
     <br><br>
    Software firewall is one that you download, and hardware is physical equipment installed into the system. Some types of firewalls are Next Gen firewalls, Proxy firewalls, Network Address Translation firewalls and more. </p>

   <h2 style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;" > The Types of Firewalls</h2>
   
   <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Firewalls were first created in the 1980s and, like all technology, has massively progressed since then. According to the article, 
   <a href= "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9720435?casa_token=-CerGvdAf-kAAAAA:Ck2KsvXbJsIPWixlfbF55cq7902icfEMjokjfbtBTzrDik2Hg6jHFTmn20Z1iDFhVljZdyKCKK8 "> "Evolution of Firewalls: Toward Securer Network Using Next Generation Firewall," by J. Liang </a> 
   there are six different types of firewalls defined. The site also goes more in depth and explains the pros and cons of each type and their unique features. <br>
   <br>The six types from the article are Packet filtering firewall, statful firewall, circuit gateway firewall, application gateway firewall, web application firewall, unified threat manageme.  I highly recommend reader to check the orginal article for a more through explaination.</p>

  <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Then there is Next Generation Firewalls. New Generation Firewall depends on signature based and heuristic based detection for threats. In conclusion the article says that although the new firewalls are a lot stronger in today's advancing world, they lack basic protection that the traditional firewalls have and that it will always be better to layer a range of different firewalls.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;" > More Than One</h2>
    
    <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> Although firewalls are extremely strong and reliable on their own, they are <b>not</b> the fix all solution. Firewalls hold this stigma of being the sole best defense in a cyber sense alone, however with the progression of technology, even the best firewall can not 100% guarantee protection alone. 
    <br><br>
    Like everything cyber related, the attacks are evolving; these attacks are using encryption, using exploits, finding paths around the firewall. The same goes for any one stand alone protection, and therefore no one should rely on firewalls alone but rely on a range of different types of system security.

        <div class="card">
         <h2 style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;" > Conclusion</h2>
         <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> 
         Firewalls are a very helpful and strong tool for system security. There are many different types of firewalls that have individual strengths and weaknesses, and not a single firewall alone will fix all problems. It is best to layer different firewalls and also have different types of security as well.</p>
