     <h1>Encryptions</h1>
    <p> By Dominic Garcia, April 22,2022 </p>
       <h2>Introduction to Encryptions</h2>
       <p>Encryptions are slightly more unknown but like all other types of security just as important. But because they are less talked about, not many people know what they are or how they work, and that is what we are outlining below.</p>

       <h2>What are Encryptions and Why we need them</h2>
       <p>The strength of the encryptions depends on the length of its security key. Encryption makes it much more difficult for even a company to analyze their own data.Encryptions are to protect the data that is stored on a computer or a network storage.</p>
      
         <h3>Types of encryptions</h3> <p>There are two types of encryptions: Asymmetric and symmetric encryptions.</p><ul>
         
         <li>Symmetric encryption the same security key used for the encryption and to decrypt it.</li>
         <li> Compared To Asymmetrical that uses a different key for the encryption and decryption, one key is known as a public key and the other is known as a private key. </li> </ul>
      
            <h3>Methods of Encryptions</h3> 
            <ol>
            <li>The first is known as Symmetric Encryption Cryptography, it uses the same security for encrypting and decoding the message from sender to receiver. </li>
            <li>The second is Asymmetrical Encryption Cryptography which uses two different keys one a public and the other private for encrypting and decrypting data. When using the second method a person can encrypt messages using the receiverâ€™s public key but can only be decrypted by the private key the receiver has. </li>   </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Having encryption programs take your information and turn it into a binary code to protect it is important to have. it is a second step that can be taken for security after firewalls, having your data encrypted adds the layer of difficulty to have to go into and decrypt it all.</p>
